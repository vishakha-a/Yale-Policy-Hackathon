# Yale-Policy-Hackathon

### Problem Statement by Yale University 

##### Your task, as a government official, is twofold:
##### First, draft a program proposal to mitigate at least one of the following challenges that our current prison systems face: unsanitary and inadequate facilities, safety concerns, and lack of basic necessities such as education, healthcare, clean water and nutritious foods. Feel free to build upon existing policies enacted by states or districts. You can also look internationally to see how other nations have responded. Don’t feel obligated to find comprehensive data directly supporting your specific proposal; while it’s crucial to draw upon existing literature, you can be creative with how you synthesize research and use it to inform policy options.
##### Second, craft a set of adaptable protocols to increase transparency from prisons about prisoners’ treatment and better enforce the sustainment of prisoners’ human rights. To the extent possible, specify the certain conditions that need to be met and maintained in order to avoid whatever consequences you deem reasonable. Take into account the unique environments of prisons, the current state of the American prison system, and the logistical challenges of implementing reforms on a large-scale.
